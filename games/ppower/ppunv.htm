          <font size="-3" color="#999999">To put all the bla-bla in few words 
          : Pure Power is not a game that has a story, but a story that has a 
          game. What does this means ? Tha</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#CCCCCC"></font><font size="-3" color="#999999">t 
          our main concern was to create the universe and the atmosphere and then 
          to make the interface for the player with this universe : the game. 
          Moving units from here to there is just a piece in a mechanism that 
          works to keep the player involved in the universe. Basically this is 
          less a real time tactical game, than an interactive book. Meaning that 
          everything - music, sounds, graphics, backgrounds, stories, historical 
          events, characters, tactical moves - has to submit to this goal - of 
          keeping the player here.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Keeping the player involved&quot; is that kind of sintagm that 
          we hate about PR reports. For not-so-crisp-people, it means we're trying 
          to make our players fondly remember that they've once played the role 
          of a tac-commander and took part at an far-from-reality adventure. <br>
          <br>
          So you will interact with the Pure Power universe through three games 
          : Pure Power, PP online and Pure Power 2. These games will polish every 
          aspect of the PP universe until you will be ready to face the AR universe.

          father returned home today. Oh I'm so happy to see him. Several days 
          ago I saw on Global Net daily reports that he saved the emperor's life. 
          The emperor wanted to inspect some thagian orbital platforms and test 
          the new plasma cannons against the thagian fighters carcasses. He only 
          wanted one wing man, and that was my father. They approached the platform, 
          and were suddenly jumped by 6 thagian fighters. After a short dogfight, 
          the thagian fighters went bye bye, their carcasses floating aimlessly 
          in space. My father incinerated 4 thagians pilots, 2 of them trying 
          to shoot the emperor's six. The following days I will train my sword 
          skills against a honorable hero that is my father. Even if I'll lose, 
          at least I have the excuse a honorable man beat me."<br>

          my tacsquad returned from a routine patrol on the sands of the border 
          world Clearance IV, and the commander of the garrison gave me the news 
          of my parents death. A new colony had to be established on the border 
          world of Remainder VI. My mother commanded the ground garrison, while 
          my father was in command of the stellar fleet; his destroyer "Hammer" 
          <a href="gfx_unv/ship1.jpg"><img src="gfx_unv/ship1small.jpg" width="100" height="35" align="left" border="0"></a>and 
          the carrier "Nova" surveyed the drop ships as they carried people and 
          materials to the planet surface. One week later, a barbarian fleet exited 
          from The Ocean and attacked out people. "Nova" died very soon in a ball 
          of flames, while my father's "Hammer" still fought desperately to allow 
          the civilians to escape. The fight took 12 hours, and the dishonorable 
          barbarians finally used interdicted nuclear missiles to wipe out the 
          civilians and garrison on the planet. "Hammer" was hitted hard by the 
          nuclear missiles, and eventually became a mini sun. This was the end 
          of my parents and of more than 10000 people, both military and civilians. 
          Several days later, a clan Steel Iris cruiser arrived in Remainder system, 
          alerted by the escaping civilians. There was nothing more to do for 
          our people, but the cruiser managed to identify the attackers. They 
          were the barbarians known as (?). I was informed of this, and now I 
          know the one who will taste my wraith when my tac-commander skills will 
          grow strong enough." <br>

          glow of the holoprojector, stood the emperor himself. I bow before him,

          in several weeks, as agreed on a meeting on Allegiance V with thagian 
          leaders, and they will have the offensive opportunity this time. He 
          also told me that talented young tac-commanders are needed in this war, 
          to show that The Interface designed 50 years ago hasn't aged and is 
          still operational and ready to aid The Rion win new victories on the 
          battlefield. In the memory of my father, he granted me access to clan 
          armories, to clan garrisons and to the spectre clusters, so that I will 
          have the best trained men and the latest military hardware. Also, I 
          was granted with one of the fastest troop carrier designed in the space 
          docks of Port Said. Now I'm waiting my tacsquad and the "Eris", the
